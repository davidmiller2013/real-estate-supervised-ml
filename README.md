### Business Problem

From the perspective of an online real estate market company, there are two challenges:  
  - Accurately assess home values by neighborhood  
  - Determine importance of various attributes in determining that value  

Developing a data-driven / model-based approach can potentially:  
  - Provide more precision in valuation methodology  
  - Assess what factors drive the overall value of a home
