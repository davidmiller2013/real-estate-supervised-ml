### Business Problem

From the perspective of an online real estate market company, there are two challenges:  
    - Assess the appropriate value for homes in certain neighborhoods/markets  
    - Weigh the importance of various attributes to potential home buyers  

Developing a data-driven / model-based approach can potentially:  
    - Provide more precision in valuation methodology  
    - Assess what factors drive the overall value of a home  


### Background Research

**Zillow**

Zillow is an online real estate marketplace company.  

Zillow is famous for using state of the art statistical and machine learning models to produce Zestimates (their trademarked valuation model).  

To calculate a Zestimate, Zillow uses a sophisticated neural network-based model that incorporates data from the following sources:  
    - County and tax assessor records and direct feeds from hundreds of multiple listing services and brokerages  
    - Home characteristics including square footage, location or the number of bathrooms  
    - On-market data such as listing price, description, comparable homes in the area and days on the market  
    - Off-market data â€” tax assessments, prior sales and other publicly available records  
    - Market trends, including seasonal changes in demand
